# JavaScript Program for Speeding Ticket System
Description
This JavaScript program takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

# Set Up Instructions
To use this program:

Save the JavaScript code in a file with a .js extension (e.g., speedingTicket.js).
Open the file in a web browser or a JavaScript runtime environment.
Follow the prompts to input the speed of the car and view the result.
